3. **upload.js**: Enhanced with dedicated profile image upload function

### Key Functions
- `uploadProfileImage(file)`: Handles file validation and Cloudinary upload

- `handleRemoveImage()`: Removes selected image and resets state

### File Validation
- **Types**: JPG, PNG, GIF (any image/* MIME type)
- **Size**: Maximum 5MB
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for invalid files

### State Management
- `imagePreview`: Stores base64 preview of selected image

- `tempValue`: Stores the Cloudinary URL after successful upload

## Usage Flow
1. User clicks edit icon on profile image
2. Modal opens with current image displayed
3. User clicks "Upload New Image" to select file
4. File is validated and preview is shown
5. Image is uploaded to Cloudinary
6. User clicks "Save" to update profile
7. Profile is refreshed with new image

## Error Handling
- Invalid file type: "Please select a valid image file"
- File too large: "Image size should be less than 5MB"
- Upload failure: "Failed to upload image. Please try again."
- Network errors: Graceful fallback with user notification

## Security
